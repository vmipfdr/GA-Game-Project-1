# Project #4: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I create a basic game using HTML, CSS and
JS! I chose from the following options:

- **Flash Cards**
- **Trivia (Self-scoring)**
- **Hangman**
- **Tower of Hanoi**
- **Simon**

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

The game must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online, using [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits

### Necessary Deliverables

Your submission must include **all** of the following:

- A `readme.md` file, including
  - Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation
    instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
  - [Follow this mini-lesson on writing documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/markdown-and-documentation)
    for your project

## Presentations

We expect everyone to attend all presentations in their entirety and will
provide breaks between each session.

This means **no working on your code** while others are presenting. This is your
chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

Each session of presentations will be science-fair style. Several people will
set up at a given time, and other students will walk around asking questions
like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?
