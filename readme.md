# Project #4: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I create a basic game using HTML, CSS and
JS! I chose from the following options:

- **Flash Cards**
- **Trivia (Self-scoring)**
- **Hangman**
- **Tower of Hanoi**
- **Simon**

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

The game must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online, using [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits

## Submission

Submit my project as an issue to this repo:

[github.com/ga-dc/project1-gallery](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1-gallery/issues/new)

### Necessary Deliverables

Your submission must include **all** of the following:

- A hosted copy of your game, built by you, hosted on Github Pages
- Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu)
  and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the
  very beginning of the project
- A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo
- A `readme.md` file, including
  - Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation
    instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
  - [Follow this mini-lesson on writing documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/markdown-and-documentation)
    for your project

### Self-scoring Trivia

Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you
can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

_Bonus:_

- Add time-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
- Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

[Here's an example from a previous student](https://sathyaram.github.io/oscarstriviagame/)

## Useful Resources

- [MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  _(a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)_
- [jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com) _(if you're using jQuery)_
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) _(for hosting your game)_

## Evaluation

Your instructors will use this rubric to assess your project:

[Evaluation Rubric](evaluation.md)

## Presentations

We expect everyone to attend all presentations in their entirety and will
provide breaks between each session.

This means **no working on your code** while others are presenting. This is your
chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

Each session of presentations will be science-fair style. Several people will
set up at a given time, and other students will walk around asking questions
like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?
