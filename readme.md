# I Built a Trivia Game

I create a basic game using HTML, CSS and
JS!

### Technical Requirements

The game I built must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online, using https://vmipfdr.github.io/GA-Game-Project-1/
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits

## Explanation of Project

I used Object Oriented Programming to tackle this project.  I initially used two functions, then expanded the complexity as I conquered tasks.  

I started with my array of objects.  Each object had a question, an array of possibilities, an answer, and some amplifying information.

I built a counter to progress through the array.  I also built a score counter that references the comparison function.

Once I completed the basic steps, I focused heavily on making the user experience as streamlined as I could in the time alloted.  I used a bunch of event listeners to adjust CSS styles.  I also spent a bunch of time focusing on building the website in a way that required less media query content. 

This should also be easily scalable to an API if I need it to.
